The Abolitionist Project has the modest goal of eliminating all unnecessary suffering on earth. Itâ€™s done in 3 easy steps!

1. Learn About Problems and Solutions

Everyone should submit an article which attempts to provide quantitative details about what they would consider to be the worst problem in the world. Everyone should also submit their idea for the best a solution to some problem. It doesn't have to be an original idea, just what you think the best one is.

2. Decide

Decide which problems cause the most suffering and which solutions are most cost effective. This was not previously something that could be quantified. However, crowd-sourcing which could be used to facilitate this. 

Cost-effectiveness calculations
In each Problem post, readers may submit their estimations of the magnitude of the suffering (either using a dollar figure or a unit of pleasure called a util or hedon) caused by each major world problem. All submissions are then averaged and problems are ranked according to the degree of suffering caused by each.

Users can also submit ideas for possible solutions. Then everyone can submit their estimates on how much each solution will cost and how much suffering it will reduce. Then the amount of suffering eliminated divided by the cost of the solution will give you a value representative of the cost-effectiveness of that solution. This step is known as the Crowdsourcing Utopia Project.

3. Act

In the final step, a charitable foundation will acquire and direct resources towards realizing the most cost effective solutions. This might be called the Charitable Foundation for the Abolition of Suffering. It is hoped that this will take over many functions that government is currently supposed to be fulfilling, but is not due to incompetence and/or corruption.
