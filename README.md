The Abolitionist Project has the modest goal of eliminating all unnecessary suffering on earth. Itâ€™s done in 3 easy steps!

LEARN About Problems and Solutions

Problems: Please submit an article which provides a quantitative examination of a problem that you would consider to cause the greatest suffering. 

Solutions: After reading about a Problem, you should also submit a solution to that problem.  The solution need not be original, just whatever you think would be most effective.  After publishing, your Solution will be listed below the problem article. 

DECIDE Which Solution is Most Cost-Effective

Estimating the Cost of Problems: After reading about a Problem, you should allocate some fraction of your taxes to solving this problem. This figure should based your estimation of the magnitude of the suffering caused by that problem relative to all others you've read about. An increase or decrease in allocation towards one problem will result in a proportional increase or decrease in their previous allocations to any other problems.  Averaging all user tax allocations will provide a quantitative estimate of magnitude of the suffering. 

Estimating the Cost of Solutions: After reading about a solution, you should submit your guess as to how much that solution will cost to fully implement. The average estimated suffering caused by the problem divided by the average estimated cost of the solution will give you a value representative of the cost-effectiveness of that solution. 

ACT to Reduce Suffering

In the final step, a charitable foundation will acquire and direct resources towards realizing the most cost effective solutions.
